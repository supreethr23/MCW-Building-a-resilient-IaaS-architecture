# Exercise 1: Enable High Availability for the Contoso Application

### Estimated Duration: 90 Minutes

In this exercise, you will convert the Contoso application's deployment in the <inject key="Region" enableCopy="false" /> region into a highly available architecture by adding redundancy to each tier, including the web, database, and domain controller VMs.

### Objectives
In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks:
   - **Task 1:** Deploy HA Resources
   - **Task 2:** Configure HA for the Domain Controller Tier
   - **Task 3:** Configure HA for the SQL Server Tier
   - **Task 4:** Configure HA for the Web Tier

### Task 1: Deploy HA Resources

You will deploy additional web, database, and domain controller VMs in this task.
A template will be used to save time. You will configure each tier in subsequent exercises in this lab.

1. Copy the link provided and paste it into a browser inside the VM. This will help you launch the template deployment for the additional infrastructure components, and that further will be used to enable high availability for the Contoso application. Log in to the Azure portal using your subscription credentials.
   
    [![Button to deploy the Contoso High Availability resource template to Azure.](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton "Deploy the Contoso HA resources to Azure")](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FCloudLabs-MCW%2FMCW-Building-a-resilient-IaaS-architecture%2Fprod%2FHands-on%20lab%2FResources%2Ftemplates%2Fcontoso-iaas-ha.json)

1.  Insert the details provided into the **Custom deployment** blade:

    - Resource Group: **ContosoRG1 (1)** (existing)
    - Location: **<inject key="Region" enableCopy="false"/>** (2).

    Select **Review + Create (3)** and then click on **Create** to deploy resources.

    ![The custom deployment screen with ContosoRG1 as the resource group.](images/iaas-image1.png "Custom deployment")

1.  While you wait for the HA resources to get deployed, take some time to review the template contents. You can review the template by navigating to the **ContosoRG1** resource group. Click on **Deployments** in the resource group, then select any deployments, followed by a **template**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the HA template contents.](images/Deployment02.png "Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the HA template contents.")

    Note that the template includes five sub-templates containing the various resources required for:

    -   The ADVM2 virtual machine, which will be a second Domain Controller.
    -   The SQLVM2 virtual machine, which will be a second SQL Server.
    -   The WebVM2 virtual machine, which will be a second web server.
    -   Two load balancers, one for the web tier and one for the SQL tier.
    -   The virtual network with the proper DNS configuration in place.

1.  You can check the HA resource deployment status by navigating to the **ContosoRG1** resource group. Select **Deployments** in the resource group and check the status of the deployments. Ensure the deployment status is marked as **Succeeded** for all available templates before proceeding to the next task.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the template deployment status 'Succeeded' for each template.](images/iaas-image2.png "Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the template deployment status Succeeded for each template")

   <validation step="ccb0033a-ade9-4c32-a114-01ddcf952476" />

### Task 2: Configure HA for the Domain Controller Tier

In this task, you will reboot all the virtual machines to ensure they receive the updated DNS settings.

When using a domain controller VM in Azure, other VMs in the virtual network must be configured to use the domain controller as their DNS server. This is achieved by setting the DNS settings in the virtual network. These settings are then picked up by the VMs when they reboot or renew their DHCP lease.

The initial deployment included a first domain controller VM, **ADVM1**, with a static private IP address **10.0.3.100**. Then, the IP address was configured in the VNet DNS settings.

The HA resources template has added a second domain controller, **ADVM2**, with a static private IP address **10.0.3.101**. This server has already been promoted to a domain controller using a CustomScriptExtension (you can review this script if you like, and you will find it linked from the ADVM2 deployment template). The template also updated the DNS setting on the virtual network to include the IP address of the second domain controller.


1. In the **search resources, services, and docs (G+/)** box at the top of the portal, enter **Virtual machines (1)** and then select **Virtual machines (2)** from the results.

     ![](images/iaas-image3.png "Screenshot of the Azure portal searching and selecting virtual machine")

1. Restart the **ADVM1** and **ADVM2** virtual machines in the **ContosoRG1** resource group. When prompted to **Restart this virtual machine**, click **Yes** to ensure they pick up the new DNS server settings.
   
    ![Restart the VM.](images/iaas-image4.png "Custom deployment")

    ![Restart the VM.](images/iaas-image5.png "Custom deployment")

1. Wait a minute or two for the domain controller VMs to boot fully, then restart the **WebVM1**, **WebVM2**, **SQLVM1**, and **SQLVM2** virtual machines so they also pick up the new DNS server settings.


### Task 3: Configure HA for the SQL Server Tier

In this task, you will build a **Windows Failover Cluster** and configure **SQL Always On Availability Groups** to create a high availability database tier.


1. In the **search resources, services, and docs (G+/)** box at the top of the portal, enter **Storage accounts (1)** and then select **Storage accounts (2)** from the results.

You have now successfully set up the SQL Server VMs to use Always On Availability Groups with a Cloud Witness storage account located in another region.

### Task 4: Configure HA for the Web tier

In this task, you will configure a High Availability web tier. This comprises two web server VMs, which you will locate behind an Azure load balancer. You will also configure the VMs to access the database using the Always On Availability Group endpoint you created earlier.

1.  In the Azure portal, navigate to **WebVM1**, select **Connect** followed by **Bastion**, and connect to the VM using the following credentials:

    - **Username**: `demouser@contoso.com`
    - **Password**: `Demo!pass123`

1.  In **WebVM1**, open Windows Explorer, navigate to **C:\inetpub\wwwroot** and open the **Web.config** file using Notepad.

    > **Note**: If the **Web.config** change does not run, go to **Start**, **Run**, and type **iisreset /restart** from the command line.

1.  In the **Web.config** file, locate the **\<ConnectionStrings\>** element and replace **SQLVM1** with **BCDRAOG** in the data source. Remember to **Save** the file.

1.  Repeat the above steps to make the exact change on **WebVM2**.

1.  Return to the Azure portal and navigate to the **ContosoWebLBPrimary** load balancer blade. Select **Backend pools (1)** and open **BackEndPool1(1) (2)**.

1.  In the **BackEndPool1** blade, select **VNet1 (ContosoRG1) (1)** as the virtual network. Then click **+ Add (2)** and **select the two (3)** web VMs. Moving on, click on **Save (4)**.

1.  Now check if the Contoso sample application works when accessed through the load balancer. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **ContosoWebLBPrimaryIP** resource. The public IP address is attached to the web tier load balancer front end. Copy the **DNS name** to the clipboard.

    ![Azure portal showing web load balancer public IP, with DNS name highlighted.](images1/E1T4S7.png "Public IP DNS name")

1.  Open a new browser tab and paste the DNS name. The Contoso Insurance sample app will appear as shown.

    > **Note:** You will test the HA capabilities later in the lab.

## Summary 

In this exercise, you deployed High Availability (HA) resources and configured HA for each tier, including the Domain Controller, SQL Server, and Web tiers. This ensured redundancy and fault tolerance across all critical application components.
