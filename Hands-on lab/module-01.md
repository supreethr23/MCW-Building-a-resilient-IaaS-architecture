# Exercise 1: Enable High Availability for the Contoso application

### Estimated Duration: 90 minutes

In this exercise, you will convert the Contoso application's deployment in the <inject key="Region" enableCopy="false" /> region into a highly-available architecture by adding redundancy to each tier, including the web, database, and domain controller VMs.

### Objectives
In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks:
   - Task 1: Deploy HA resources.
   - Task 2: Configure HA for the Domain Controller tier.
   - Task 3: Configure HA for the SQL Server tier.
   - Task 4: Configure HA for the Web tier

### Task 1: Deploy HA resources

In this task, you will deploy additional web, database and domain controller VMs.
A template will be used to save time. You will configure each tier in subsequent exercises in this lab.

1.  Copy the Link given below and paste it in in a browser inside the VM to launch the template deployment for the additional infrastructure components that will be used to enable high availability for the Contoso application. 
   
    [![Button to deploy the Contoso High Availability resource template to Azure.](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton "Deploy the Contoso HA resources to Azure")](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FCloudLabs-MCW%2FMCW-Building-a-resilient-IaaS-architecture%2Fprod%2FHands-on%20lab%2FResources%2Ftemplates%2Fcontoso-iaas-ha.json)

1. If prompted to login to Azure, use the following credentials:

   - **Email/Username:** <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
   - **Password:** <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

1.  Complete the Custom deployment blade as follows:

    - Resource Group: **ContosoRG1 (1)** (existing)
    - Location: **<inject key="Region" enableCopy="false"/>** (2).

    Select **Review + Create (3)** and then **Create** to deploy resources.

    ![The custom deployment screen with ContosoRG1 as the resource group.](images/iaas-image1.png "Custom deployment")

1.  While you wait for the HA resources to deploy, take some time review the template contents. You can review the template by navigating to the **ContosoRG1** resource group, selecting **Deployments** in the resource group left-nav, and selecting any of the deployments, followed by **template**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the HA template contents.](images/Deployment02.png "Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the HA template contents.")

    Note that the template contains five child templates, containing the various resources required for:

    -   The ADVM2 virtual machine, which will be a second Domain Controller.
    -   The SQLVM2 virtual machine, which will be a second SQL Server.
    -   The WebVM2 virtual machine, which will be a second web server.
    -   Two load balancers, one for the web tier, and one for the SQL tier.
    -   The virtual network with the proper DNS configuration in place.

1.  You can check the HA resource deployment status by navigating to the **ContosoRG1** resource group, selecting **Deployments** in the resource group left-nav, and checking the status of the deployments. Make sure the deployment status is **Succeeded** for all templates before proceeding to the next task.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the template deployment status 'Succeeded' for each template.](images/iaas-image2.png "Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the template deployment status Succeeded for each template")

   <validation step="ccb0033a-ade9-4c32-a114-01ddcf952476" />

### Task 2: Configure HA for the Domain Controller tier

In this task, you will reboot all the virtual machines to ensure they receive the updated DNS settings.

When using a domain controller VM in Azure, other VMs in the virtual network must be configured to use the domain controller as their DNS server. This is achieved by setting the DNS settings in the virtual network. These settings are then picked up by the VMs when they reboot or renew their DHCP lease.

The initial deployment included a first domain controller VM, **ADVM1**, with static private IP address **10.0.3.100**. The initial deployment also configured this IP address in the VNet DNS settings.

The HA resources template has added a second domain controller **ADVM2**, with static private IP address **10.0.3.101**. This server has already been promoted to be a domain controller using a CustomScriptExtension (you can review this script if you like, you'll find it linked from the ADVM2 deployment template). The template also updated the DNS setting on the virtual network to include the IP address of the second domain controller.


1. In Search resources, services, and docs (G+/) box at the top of the portal, enter **Virtual machine**, and then select **Virtual machine** from the results.

     ![](images/iaas-image3.png "Screenshot of the Azure portal searching and selecting virtual machine")

1. Restart the **ADVM1** and **ADVM2** virtual machines in the **ContosoRG1** resource group. When prompted with **Restart this Virtual Machine**, click **Yes** to ensure they pick up the new DNS server settings.
   
    ![Restart the VM.](images/iaas-image4.png "Custom deployment")

    ![Restart the VM.](images/iaas-image5.png "Custom deployment")

1. Wait a minute or two for the domain controller VMs to fully boot, then restart the **WebVM1**, **WebVM2**, **SQLVM1** and **SQLVM2** virtual machines, so they also pick up the new DNS server settings.


### Task 3: Configure HA for the SQL Server tier

In this task, you will build a Windows Failover Cluster and configure SQL Always On Availability Groups to create a high-availability database tier.

1. Move back to Failover Cluster Manager on **SQLVM1**, and you can review the IP Addresses that were added by selecting Roles and **BCDRAOG** and viewing the Resources. Notice how the **10.0.2.100** is Online.

    ![In the Failover Cluster Manager tree view, Roles is selected. Under Roles, BCDRAOG is selected, and details of the role display.](images1/E1T3S61.png "Failover Cluster Manager")

You have now successfully set up the SQL Server VMs to use Always On Availability Groups with a Cloud Witness storage account located in another region.

### Task 4: Configure HA for the Web tier

In this task, you will configure a high-availability web tier. This comprises two web server VMs which you will locate behind an Azure load balancer. You will also configure the VMs to access the database using the Always On Availability Group endpoint you created earlier.

1.  In the Azure portal, navigate to **WebVM1**, select **Connect** followed by **Bastion**, and connect to the VM using the following credentials:

    - **Username**: `demouser@contoso.com`
    - **Password**: `Demo!pass123`

1.  In **WebVM1**, open Windows Explorer, navigate to **C:\inetpub\wwwroot** and open the **Web.config** file using Notepad.

    ![notepad.](images1/notepad.png "Failover Cluster Manager")

    > **Note**: If the **Web.config** change does not run, go to **Start**, **Run** and type **iisreset /restart** from command line.

1.  In the **Web.config** file, locate the **\<ConnectionStrings\>** element and replace **SQLVM1** with **BCDRAOG** in the data source. Remember to **Save** the file.

    ![Notepad is editing the Web.config file. The data source is updated to BCDRAOG.contoso.com.](images1/E1T4S3.png "Web.config file")

1.  Repeat the above steps to make the same change on **WebVM2**.

1.  Return to the Azure portal and navigate to the **ContosoWebLBPrimary** load balancer blade. Select **Backend pools** and open **BackEndPool1**.

    > **Note:** You will test the HA capabilities later in the lab.

## Summary 

In this exercise, the you deployed high availability (HA) resources and configured HA for each tier, including the Domain Controller, SQL Server, and Web tiers. This ensured redundancy and fault tolerance across all critical application components.
